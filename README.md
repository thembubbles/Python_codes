# Python_scripts
This is my repository for python scripts I've made/used.

All codes were developed in the jupyter notebook.

There are three types of files:
-**basic** - represents simple or general tasks with python (e.g. bulk renaming files in a folder)
-**processing** - codes intented to perform any sort of calculation in data inputs and output the results
-**plots** - generates graphs from data inputs
